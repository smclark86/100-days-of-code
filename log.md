# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: June 10, Saturday - 3.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I joined FreeCodeCamp (FCC), and did the intro challenges. I also joined CodeAcademy and did 57% of the HTML & CSS tutorials on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: I've had some minor experience with coding since high school, but have never really committed to learning. After finishing the sections I did today in FCC I realize that I have really only been barely scratching the surface all these years. I've mainly decided to work on learning since I want to pursue a Masters in Nursing Informatics in the future, and figured a background in coding and application design might help me be more successful.


### Day 2: June 11, Sunday - 7 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the HTML & CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, Gear Up for Success, and started jQuery on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I know I shouldn't be going through these too quickly, but since I am somewhat familiar with some of the concepts from HTML & CSS I am learning quickly. I know I'll need to review though. And keep focused on finishing my Bachelors degree...only two more months to go until graduation!


### Day 3: June 12, Monday - 3.75 hours

**Today's Progress**: I completed the HTML & CSS course on CodeAcademy, and started the Make a Website course there. I have also completed the jQuery segment on FCC. Now I shall begin the first of the FCC Front End Development projects: The Tribute Page.

**Thoughts**: This FCC project is interesting. I think it will help me be more proficient in remembering the basics of HTML and CSS, though I'm not sure yet if I'll have to use any of the jQuery stuff I learned at this point. More updates soon.


### Day 4: June 13, Tuesday - 10 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the FCC Tribute Page project. I need to stay more focused on school right now, so less time tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: It took forever for me to figure out a problem I had with a div not centering. So frustrating! I was using text-align: center to do it, but after over an hour of messing with it, I moved it up to the parent div (which was a bootstrap grid), and it fixed the problem. I'm guessing that bootstrap grids have priority? I'll have to do some further reading about this. And now I just realized somehow that the page isn't responsive because I didn't set any break points and more... Just because I know basic syntax doesn't mean I know anything yet, right? There's still lots to learn.


### Day 5: June 14, Tuesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on and completed the CodeAcademy Make a Website course. It was a nice refresher of some basics, and I feel like I would have experienced less confusion while working on the FCC Tribute Page project if I had done this first. Since I'm mentioning that project, I didn't realize at first that I wasn't supposed to look at the code for how the example was made, so I think I'm going to start the project over from scratch to give myself more practice. I also started the Deploy a Website course on CodeAcademy, but quickly discovered that I should probably learn how to use the command line and Git first. So, I started the command line course, as well. I have a little bit of experience with command line, but not much, and am learning a bunch.

**Thoughts**: Today was nice because I got to review the basics a little more just like I had wanted to yesterday. Good progress today.


### Day 6: June 15, Tuesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: I finished the CodeAcademy Learn the Command Line course and went through the entire Learn Git course, as well.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting learning about the command line and Git today. I have learned a little about the command line in the past, but there's definitely a bunch of info I didn't know about it (which I had expected). The Git course was super interesting. Git and Command Line are things that I wish were suggested as the first thing to learn when it comes to coding. I'm lucky that what I learned super quickly while I was starting this #100DaysOfCode project helped me to use Git without screwing up, or embarrasing myself by initiating a pull request or something to the original master of this project, lol. I'm still don't have 100% understanding of the command line or Git yet, but I'm sure it will just take some more practice.
