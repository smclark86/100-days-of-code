# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: June 10, Saturday - 3.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I joined FreeCodeCamp (FCC), and did the intro challenges. I also joined CodeAcademy and did 57% of the HTML & CSS tutorials on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: I've had some minor experience with coding since high school, but have never really committed to learning. After finishing the sections I did today in FCC I realize that I have really only been barely scratching the surface all these years. I've mainly decided to work on learning since I want to pursue a Masters in Nursing Informatics in the future, and figured a background in coding and application design might help me be more successful.


### Day 2: June 11, Sunday - 7 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the HTML & CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, Gear Up for Success, and started jQuery on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I know I shouldn't be going through these too quickly, but since I am somewhat familiar with some of the concepts from HTML & CSS I am learning quickly. I know I'll need to review though. And keep focused on finishing my Bachelors degree...only two more months to go until graduation!


### Day 3: June 12, Monday - 3.75 hours

**Today's Progress**: I completed the HTML & CSS course on CodeAcademy, and started the Make a Website course there. I have also completed the jQuery segment on FCC. Now I shall begin the first of the FCC Front End Development projects: The Tribute Page.

**Thoughts**: This FCC project is interesting. I think it will help me be more proficient in remembering the basics of HTML and CSS, though I'm not sure yet if I'll have to use any of the jQuery stuff I learned at this point. More updates soon.


### Day 4: June 13, Tuesday - 10 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the FCC Tribute Page project. I need to stay more focused on school right now, so less time tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: It took forever for me to figure out a problem I had with a div not centering. So frustrating! I was using text-align: center to do it, but after over an hour of messing with it, I moved it up to the parent div (which was a bootstrap grid), and it fixed the problem. I'm guessing that bootstrap grids have priority? I'll have to do some further reading about this. And now I just realized somehow that the page isn't responsive because I didn't set any break points and more... Just because I know basic syntax doesn't mean I know anything yet, right? There's still lots to learn.


### Day 5: June 14, Wednesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on and completed the CodeAcademy Make a Website course. It was a nice refresher of some basics, and I feel like I would have experienced less confusion while working on the FCC Tribute Page project if I had done this first. Since I'm mentioning that project, I didn't realize at first that I wasn't supposed to look at the code for how the example was made, so I think I'm going to start the project over from scratch to give myself more practice. I also started the Deploy a Website course on CodeAcademy, but quickly discovered that I should probably learn how to use the command line and Git first. So, I started the command line course, as well. I have a little bit of experience with command line, but not much, and am learning a bunch.

**Thoughts**: Today was nice because I got to review the basics a little more just like I had wanted to yesterday. Good progress today.


### Day 6: June 15, Thursday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: I finished the CodeAcademy Learn the Command Line course and went through the entire Learn Git course, as well.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting learning about the command line and Git today. I have learned a little about the command line in the past, but there's definitely a bunch of info I didn't know about it (which I had expected). The Git course was super interesting. Git and Command Line are things that I wish were suggested as the first thing to learn when it comes to coding. I'm lucky that what I learned super quickly while I was starting this #100DaysOfCode project helped me to use Git without screwing up, or embarrasing myself by initiating a pull request or something to the original master of this project, lol. I'm still don't have 100% understanding of the command line or Git yet, but I'm sure it will just take some more practice.


### Day 7: June 16, Friday - 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CodeAcademy Deploy a Website course today. I had heard of Jekyll in passing before, but never really knew what it was. I'll have to read up on it some more. Also fixed a bunch of errors in my #100DaysOfCode log. Apparently, because I had been copying and pasting my daily titles I had changed the dates, but not the days. 

**Thoughts**: I had no idea that you could host pages through Github, and I had no real idea of what Jekyll was. I'm still a bit confused about making changes to the Jekyll site hosted on Github, so I will do some more reading about both of these things. Quite an interesting day!


### Day 8: June 17, Saturday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CodeAcademy Learn Sass course. I'm still quite confused about how to correctly use Sass, but I'm sure that there will be more learning opportunities in the future. I'm not sure if I would want to use it very much right now because I am still learning basic CSS, so may once I am more proficient in CSS I will begin implementing Sass. I also started the Learn Responsive Design course on CodeAcademy. I think after I am finished with this course I will devote my time to completing the FCC Basic Front End Development Projects. Hopefully, I will have processed more of what I have learned recently and know better how to implement that information to complete those basic projects on my own. 

**Thoughts**: I already touched on this, but I am still pretty confused with how to implement Sass. I would like to learn more about it in the future though, because I can really appreciate how it can cut down on having to repeat code in different places. I'm looking forward to finishing the Learn Responsive Design course because I think that by then I will have built a pretty solid foundation of knowledge with which to complete the FCC projects.


### Day 9: June 18, Sunday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Learn Responsive Design course from CodeAcademy today, and I also started Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. 

**Thoughts**: Responsive design is quite interesting. I have customized pre-made Wordpress sites in the past that utilized this, but I enoyed learning about how it works and how to implement it from scratch. In regard to the bootcamp, I figured since it seems so popular, and with the claim of so many of the people that have successfully completed this bootcamp being able to land jobs that it must be a really good course. I don't plan on doing any work as a web developer any time soon because of my current career as a nurse (except maybe for fun), but it can't hurt to help solidify and hone what I am currently learning. Today was a busy day overall, and I almost wasn't able to complete the two hours for today, but I'm glad I was able to keep up the progress.


### Day 10: June 19, Monday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I have to admit that the information that Colt includes in his bootcamp—even though it is still only covering super basic stuff at the moment—has helped me to understand the why's and how's of HTML better than both the CodeAcademy and FCC HTML courses did. For example, I was still a little unclear on block-level and inline elements, and now I totally understand them. Similarly, I now understand the difference between divs and spans. So far, I am liking this bootcamp, but I have to play most of it at 1.25x speed. Otherwise I'd feel like I'm spending too much time just sitting around and watching videos instead of making progress.


### Day 11: June 20, Tuesday - 2.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned about HTML forms and inputs.

**Thoughts**: I knew very little about forms and inputs before, and it's interesting to learn about some baisc ways that they are created and used. I'm looking forward to the ways they can be styled through CSS later in the bootcamp. I've been trying to find some info on whether there is a specific standardized order of attributes for a given element. It appears that there is, but I haven't found a good resource that gives any solid advice for what that order should be. Will keep looking.


### Day 12: June 21, Wednesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about CSS today, and also some things about the Chrome DevTools that I didn't realize were possible.

**Thoughts**: One of today's lessons had the best explanation for Hexadecimal (Base-16) I've ever heard. I had a pretty good idea of how it worked before, but now I understand it a lot better. The Chrome DevTools can do so much more than I thought! I have never really looked at any documentation before, so I'll have to do that. I know I'll be using it a lot more often now.

	
### Day 13: June 22, Thursday - 8 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned about inheritance and specificity in CSS, using and modifying text (and text properties) and fonts in CSS, completed an exercise for the bootcamp that had me create a tic-tac-toe board using CSS, and completed an exercise that had me create a minimalist photo gallery web page. I also learned about float properties in CSS, as well. And lastly, I finished my first basic front-end project for FCC—the Build a Tribute page.

**Thoughts**: Amazed at what is possible with inheritance and specificity in CSS. I know I've barely scratched the surface, but I had never really understood inheritance and specificity, so I'm really happy with what I learned today. The tic-tac-toe and photo gallery exercises have been the most fun I have had learning CSS, by far! I got mixed up between classes and id's at first in the tic-tac-toe exercise, so I had to rework it to simplify the CSS. While the photo gallery exercise was a code-along, I tried to figure out as much as I could before seeing the solution. It was quite challenging, but I enjoyed the exercise a lot. The Build a Tribute page took several hours to do, and I hope that I organized my HTML and CSS acceptably. I'm so confused about how to best organize and structure the CSS especially...I feel like it's like a jumbled mess.


### Day 14: June 23, Friday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple photo gallery page and a blog page for bootcamp exercises. I also started learning more about Bootstrap in the bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I can definitely tell I'm improving in knowledge and skill, even though I know I'm still very much a beginner. The exercises that I worked on today taught me some new things, but I also was able to figure out how to code the majority of the projects from scratch before seeing the solutions so much faster than I would have been able to last week. While learning about Bootstrap today, I realized that the reason I was confused about Bootstrap on Day 4 is because I didn't have the library installed locally, lol. That's why learning is always a good thing!


### Day 15: June 24, Saturday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned some more about some Bootstrap basics today.

**Thoughts**: I had no idea that you could either install Bootstrap locally, or just link to it via CDN. Bootstrap just seemed so daunting before starting to learn about it in the bootcamp, but I'm excited to learn more. It definitely looks like quite a powerful tool. I had some trouble at first while messing with a navbar, and I finally figured out that it was because I had the closing tag for the navbar-header div in the wrong place. Definitely got some practice Googling for answers today!


### Day 16: June 25, Sunday - 3.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Bootstrap's navbars and grid system. Also made a simple photo gallery using Bootstrap for bootcamp exercise. I also started working on a landing page using Bootstrap for another exercise.

**Thoughts**: Finally beginning to understand some more about Bootstrap. I was really confused before, so I'm happy to find that I'm beginning to grasp it.


### Day 17: June 26, Monday - 5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Finished landing page exercise.

**Thoughts**: I was able to code about 95% of it before seeing the solution. Most of the syntax matched the solution, too, even though I know that isn't 100% necessary. So, I can definitely tell that I'm learning and retaining all this info! And it's true, Google is my friend. Though I can't figure out why I need so many !important mentions in CSS when I post to CodePen.


### Day 18: June 27, Tuesday - 3.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Began work on portfolio page for FCC front-end project, and started learning Javascript in bootcamp!

**Thoughts**: Javascript seems pretty cool from what I've learned so far—which I know is just barely scratching the surface. I am excited to learn more!


### Day 19: June 28, Wednesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some basic Javascript exercises today.

**Thoughts**: I think I understand the basic operators, logic, and conditionals, but I can't get my scripts to run the way I am expecting them to all the time. I'm especially having a problem when I include multiple conditions in an if statement. Will keep working on it.


### Day 20: June 29, Thursday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript exercises today. Also started learning about loops.

**Thoughts**: I want to understand when to use simply separate if statements versus if and else if statements together. Maybe I was just overthinking the problem? Also, I need to review modulo. I'm still unclear about its use, especially in respect to determining odd or even numbers, and when something is divisible by something else.


### Day 21: June 30, Friday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript exercises today. Also learned about for loops and touched a little on functions.

**Thoughts**: It's interesting to see the similarity between while and for loops, but I like how for loops are more condensed and seemingly more to the point. Excited to learn more about how and why each are used. Functions seem quite powerful, and I'm looking forward to learning more about them.


### Day 22: July 1, Saturday - 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript arguments, the return keyword, function declarations versus function expressions, and scope. Did some exercises related to these things.

**Thoughts**: I did an exercise where I had to calculate the factorial of a number, but I don't know if my confusion stems from a lack of understanding in the math or in how the Javascript is written. Will have to review this a little, even though I don't really understand how something like knowing how to calculate factorials will be important in the future at all. For this exercise and one that had me replace characters I used Google, and was able to find what I needed quickly. 


### Day 23: July 2, Sunday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS higher order functions, arrays, push and pop, shift and unshift, indexOf, and slice. Started working on JS array exercise.

**Thoughts**: Very interesting stuff today. Arrays sort of seem similar to a database. I'm guessing that's what it is? Looking forward to learning more about this tomorrow.


### Day 24: July 3, Monday - 1.25 hours

**Today's Progress**: More JS arrays exercises. Started learning about array iteration.

**Thoughts**: One of today's exercises had me do new things with the array I had created in one of yesterday's exercises using the information I learned today about array iteration. I was able to figure out most of the code before seeing the solution. I feel quite good about today's learning.


### Day 25: July 4, Tuesday - 0 hours

**Today's Progress**: Wasn't able to see bootcamp videos because huge thunderstorm knocked out electricity.

**Thoughts**: I think I'll add days at the end of the 100 days to make up missing days just to hold myself accountable for the full 100 days.


### Day 26: July 5, Wednesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed past couple days of JS info.

**Thoughts**: Missing a single day really messed with my ability to remember the last couple days worth of learning. I will do my best to make sure I don't miss any more days, even though this time it was unavoidable due to losing electricity. I'm excited to really understand this info so that missing a day won't have such a bad effect on my learning. More sleep would probably help too, lol. I did realize that the reason I confused about modulo last week was because I forgot that I was using it in conjunction with a boolean, but forgot that because of the boolean it was only true or false.


### Day 27: July 6, Thursday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Finished reviewing info from past couple days. Working on array and function exercises.

**Thoughts**: I'm so confused with some exercises that are having me creating a function that takes an array as an argument. Been Googling a bunch, but haven't found an answer that works yet. I will keep trying to figure this out tomorrow.


### Day 28: July 7, Friday - 1.25 hours

**Today's Progress**: Array and function exercise.

**Thoughts**: I really don't understand how, even after reviewing the past couple days of learning, that I couldn't figure out the exercise on my own today. It all started with having to create a function that could print the values of an array (any array entered) in reverse. I spent over an hour trying to figure it out, Googled like crazy, and still had no idea how to do it. So, I had to see the solution, but I'm understanding it a little better now. I was so close to figuring it out though! I guess failure is part of learning, but it still sucks. I will keep working to improve!


### Day 29: July 8, Saturday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Another array and function exercise.

**Thoughts**: I had difficulty with the exercise today also. I still haven't looked at the solution, but I think I'm getting close to figuring the exercise out on my own. I am needing to create a function that can determine if all values in an array are identical or not. It sounds simple, but for some reason I'm having difficulty figuring it out. I will keep working on it tomorrow.


### Day 30: July 9, Sunday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: The same array and function exercise.

**Thoughts**: I was really hard-headed today, and I wanted to figure out this exercise on my own. I feel like I wasted my hour today though, because I don't think I've gotten any closer to the solution. I will just look at the solution tomorrow so that I can move onto the next thing and not make any progress. Though I guess practice is progress in a way.


### Day 31: July 10, Monday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Third array and function exercise.

**Thoughts**: One month under my belt! But, I swear I must have accidentally skipped a lesson or something in the bootcamp, because I'm having such a difficult time figuring these array and function exercises out! I think I'm going to review the past few lessons again even though I won't really be moving forward in the lessons right now. I don't feel right moving onto the next lesson yet—not until I have a better basic understanding of arrays and functions and why the solutions to these exercises work the way that they do.


### Day 32: July 11, Tuesday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Started reviewing array and function lessons.

**Thoughts**: I'm wanting to take my time going through this review, as I only spent a day reviewing last week, and I was still confused afterward. I think it will be better for me, overall, to go at a slower pace than I was going. I've received some nice encouragement in regard to my logs on Twitter and GitHub today, too, which was nice! It helped me to remember that learning is sometimes a slow process, but that if I stick with it I will begin to have better understanding than I would otherwise have had.


### Day 33: July 12, Wednesday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed a couple previous lessons.

**Thoughts**: Took my time today in reviewing a couple previous lessons. Not too eventful, but I guess it helped me to have a better understanding of the concepts the lessons covered.

### Day 34: July 13, Thursday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed a couple lessons.

**Thoughts**: Finally figured out why I was struggling with a function from the other day where I was trying to create a function that determined if all the values in an array were identical or not. It turns out, the reason it didn't work is because I was using console.log instead of return. The only thing I'm confused about now is why the function doesn't work when I call it in the JS file, but does work when I call it manually in the Chrome console.


### Day 35: July 14, Friday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed a couple function and array lessons.

**Thoughts**: While I didn't have any big realizations today like I did yesterday, it was good to review this information again. I plan to move on to new lessons tomorrow or the day after, and then review again periodically.


### Day 36: July 15, Saturday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Analyzed and reviewed a function and array exercise.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to slowly work through one of the exercises that I finished last week to make sure I am really understanding the structure and function of the code. I think that it was a helpful way to gauge understanding of why a function works the way it does, so I will probably try this again with another problem tomorrow. I think I just need to review all the basic JS again like loops, logic, etc. to help make sure I am not going so fast that I make a mistake similar to a couple days ago where I confused console.log and return.


### Day 37: July 16, Sunday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Analyzed and reviewed another function and array exercise.

**Thoughts**: I'm still a little confused about this one even though I saw the solution last week and have gone over it once since then. I am not sure what it is that confuses me about this function. It is the isUniform function that I mentioned a few times last week. Will look at the solution video again tomorrow to see if I've missed something in the explanation that is causing my confusion.


### Day 38: July 17, Monday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Analyzed and reviewed solution to function an array exercise from yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I finally understand this one! My confusion originally stemmed from a lack of understanding between console.log and return, but then I forgot that my starting position in the array when comparing each item needed to start at index of 1 and not 0. I can't believe this exercise confused me so much, but I guess that's why reviewing is necessary and helpful in learning.


### Day 39: July 18, Tuesday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: New array and function problem today.

**Thoughts**: This is my first new problem since last week. Even with the review I am feeling a little confused. I feel like this exercise should be easy to figure out, but I haven't tried Googling yet, which was maybe a bit over-confident, as I have not had to do an exercise like this before. This one has me creating a function that sums the values in an array. I think maybe the reason I can't think clearly is just because I haven't been getting enough sleep. I have been pulling several all-nighters recently as I am now in the last 4 weeks of my BSN program, and am working daily on my capstone project. I just barely had the willpower to work on an hour of coding practice before bed, so I will continue working on this same problem tomorrow. 


### Day 40: July 19, Wednesday - 0 hours

**Today's Progress**: Up all night working on capstone project, so no time to code.

**Thoughts**: I hate to miss a day of coding practice, but I am really trying to get this capstone project finished. I was up all night working on that, and I need to sleep. The up-side is that there are only 4 weeks left until I'm finished with my BSN degree! I'll make up this day at the end of the 100 days.


### Day 41: July 20, Thursday - 0 hours

**Today's Progress**: Another all-nighter working on capstone project. No coding today.

**Thoughts**: I can't wait to be finished with this project so that I can get back to coding. I will do my best to do an hour a day still, but the capstone is the priority.


### Day 42: July 21, Friday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Finally got to work on another function and array exercise.

**Thoughts**: I've been super busy with school, but I'm glad that I got to take some time to code today. I feel rusty already, and it's only been a couple days with no coding. At first, I couldn't remember how a for loop worked, and then figured it out with some Googling. After figuring out how to make the function work, I watched the solution video, and learned that I could have used a forEach instead. I tried that out, as well, and it works great. Looking forward to learning more tomorrow.


### Day 43: July 22, Saturday - 0 hours

**Today's Progress**: No time to code today, unfortunately.

**Thoughts**: I hate missing days, but I was up most of the night working on my capstone project again, so will have to make up this day.


### Day 44: July 23, Sunday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Worked on another function and array exercise.

**Thoughts**: The exercise required me to create a function that determined the largest—maximum—value in an array. I had no idea where to begin, but figured that I could use some sort of Math JS object (even though I didn't know that's what it was called, as I haven't learned about JS objects yet, and have only seen them in passing online), so I went to MDN to see what I could find. The solution I got works using Math.max.apply, but I am not sure how or why it works. I did a little more searching and couldn't find a clear explanation of what the null argument is for in Math.max.apply. What is really interesting is that the solution video for the exercise used a For loop, and stated that a forEach loop could be used, as well. I think using Math is, of course, faster and—probably—better, though I don't know if I could explain why exactly. Just for fun, I made a version of the exercise using a For looop, and I pieced together how to create the forEach version using a previous exercise as a quick refresher of how to structure a forEach, and they both work nicely. I also did a little research into why semicolons are used to separate JS statements—and after expressions—but not after declarations. That helped boost my understanding a bit, too.


### Day 45: July 24, Monday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Learned a little more about forEach, briefly touched on prototypes, and started learning about objects.

**Thoughts**: Kind of confused with some of the forEach info, but it's nice to be learning some new code. JS objects look really interesting, and I'm excited to learn more. I also learned about similarities and differences between array and object syntax. And finally, I started working on an object exercise. The learning shall continue!


### Day 46: July 25, Tuesday - 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a JS object exercise.

**Thoughts**: This exercise is pretty interesting so far, but I haven't figured this exercise out quite yet. I thought that because I had a rough idea so far of how to structure an object, that putting one inside of an array shouldn't be too difficult. For some reason, though, I am getting an unexpected identifier error in the console in the second object—but not the first—even though they are identical. I tried not to Google too much yet because I thought yesterday's lesson might give me enough clues, but I might have to look for more info before I can compelete it.


### Day 47: July 26, Wednesday - 0 hours

**Today's Progress**: Busy with capstone project again, so no coding today.

**Thoughts**: Only a little over two weeks until finished with my BSN degree though!
