# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: June 10, Saturday - 3.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I joined FreeCodeCamp (FCC), and did the intro challenges. I also joined CodeAcademy and did 57% of the HTML & CSS tutorials on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: I've had some minor experience with coding since high school, but have never really committed to learning. After finishing the sections I did today in FCC I realize that I have really only been barely scratching the surface all these years. I've mainly decided to work on learning since I want to pursue a Masters in Nursing Informatics in the future, and figured a background in coding and application design might help me be more successful.


### Day 2: June 11, Sunday - 7 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the HTML & CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, Gear Up for Success, and started jQuery on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I know I shouldn't be going through these too quickly, but since I am somewhat familiar with some of the concepts from HTML & CSS I am learning quickly. I know I'll need to review though. And keep focused on finishing my Bachelors degree...only two more months to go until graduation!


### Day 3: June 12, Monday - 3.75 hours

**Today's Progress**: I completed the HTML & CSS course on CodeAcademy, and started the Make a Website course there. I have also completed the jQuery segment on FCC. Now I shall begin the first of the FCC Front End Development projects: The Tribute Page.

**Thoughts**: This FCC project is interesting. I think it will help me be more proficient in remembering the basics of HTML and CSS, though I'm not sure yet if I'll have to use any of the jQuery stuff I learned at this point. More updates soon.


### Day 4: June 13, Tuesday - 10 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the FCC Tribute Page project. I need to stay more focused on school right now, so less time tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: It took forever for me to figure out a problem I had with a div not centering. So frustrating! I was using text-align: center to do it, but after over an hour of messing with it, I moved it up to the parent div (which was a bootstrap grid), and it fixed the problem. I'm guessing that bootstrap grids have priority? I'll have to do some further reading about this. And now I just realized somehow that the page isn't responsive because I didn't set any break points and more... Just because I know basic syntax doesn't mean I know anything yet, right? There's still lots to learn.


### Day 5: June 14, Wednesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on and completed the CodeAcademy Make a Website course. It was a nice refresher of some basics, and I feel like I would have experienced less confusion while working on the FCC Tribute Page project if I had done this first. Since I'm mentioning that project, I didn't realize at first that I wasn't supposed to look at the code for how the example was made, so I think I'm going to start the project over from scratch to give myself more practice. I also started the Deploy a Website course on CodeAcademy, but quickly discovered that I should probably learn how to use the command line and Git first. So, I started the command line course, as well. I have a little bit of experience with command line, but not much, and am learning a bunch.

**Thoughts**: Today was nice because I got to review the basics a little more just like I had wanted to yesterday. Good progress today.


### Day 6: June 15, Thursday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: I finished the CodeAcademy Learn the Command Line course and went through the entire Learn Git course, as well.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting learning about the command line and Git today. I have learned a little about the command line in the past, but there's definitely a bunch of info I didn't know about it (which I had expected). The Git course was super interesting. Git and Command Line are things that I wish were suggested as the first thing to learn when it comes to coding. I'm lucky that what I learned super quickly while I was starting this #100DaysOfCode project helped me to use Git without screwing up, or embarrasing myself by initiating a pull request or something to the original master of this project, lol. I'm still don't have 100% understanding of the command line or Git yet, but I'm sure it will just take some more practice.


### Day 7: June 16, Friday - 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CodeAcademy Deploy a Website course today. I had heard of Jekyll in passing before, but never really knew what it was. I'll have to read up on it some more. Also fixed a bunch of errors in my #100DaysOfCode log. Apparently, because I had been copying and pasting my daily titles I had changed the dates, but not the days. 

**Thoughts**: I had no idea that you could host pages through Github, and I had no real idea of what Jekyll was. I'm still a bit confused about making changes to the Jekyll site hosted on Github, so I will do some more reading about both of these things. Quite an interesting day!


### Day 8: June 17, Saturday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CodeAcademy Learn Sass course. I'm still quite confused about how to correctly use Sass, but I'm sure that there will be more learning opportunities in the future. I'm not sure if I would want to use it very much right now because I am still learning basic CSS, so may once I am more proficient in CSS I will begin implementing Sass. I also started the Learn Responsive Design course on CodeAcademy. I think after I am finished with this course I will devote my time to completing the FCC Basic Front End Development Projects. Hopefully, I will have processed more of what I have learned recently and know better how to implement that information to complete those basic projects on my own. 

**Thoughts**: I already touched on this, but I am still pretty confused with how to implement Sass. I would like to learn more about it in the future though, because I can really appreciate how it can cut down on having to repeat code in different places. I'm looking forward to finishing the Learn Responsive Design course because I think that by then I will have built a pretty solid foundation of knowledge with which to complete the FCC projects.


### Day 9: June 18, Sunday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Learn Responsive Design course from CodeAcademy today, and I also started Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. 

**Thoughts**: Responsive design is quite interesting. I have customized pre-made Wordpress sites in the past that utilized this, but I enoyed learning about how it works and how to implement it from scratch. In regard to the bootcamp, I figured since it seems so popular, and with the claim of so many of the people that have successfully completed this bootcamp being able to land jobs that it must be a really good course. I don't plan on doing any work as a web developer any time soon because of my current career as a nurse (except maybe for fun), but it can't hurt to help solidify and hone what I am currently learning. Today was a busy day overall, and I almost wasn't able to complete the two hours for today, but I'm glad I was able to keep up the progress.


### Day 10: June 19, Monday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I have to admit that the information that Colt includes in his bootcamp—even though it is still only covering super basic stuff at the moment—has helped me to understand the why's and how's of HTML better than both the CodeAcademy and FCC HTML courses did. For example, I was still a little unclear on block-level and inline elements, and now I totally understand them. Similarly, I now understand the difference between divs and spans. So far, I am liking this bootcamp, but I have to play most of it at 1.25x speed. Otherwise I'd feel like I'm spending too much time just sitting around and watching videos instead of making progress.


### Day 11: June 20, Tuesday - 2.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned about HTML forms and inputs.

**Thoughts**: I knew very little about forms and inputs before, and it's interesting to learn about some baisc ways that they are created and used. I'm looking forward to the ways they can be styled through CSS later in the bootcamp. I've been trying to find some info on whether there is a specific standardized order of attributes for a given element. It appears that there is, but I haven't found a good resource that gives any solid advice for what that order should be. Will keep looking.


### Day 12: June 21, Wednesday - 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about CSS today, and also some things about the Chrome DevTools that I didn't realize were possible.

**Thoughts**: One of today's lessons had the best explanation for Hexadecimal (Base-16) I've ever heard. I had a pretty good idea of how it worked before, but now I understand it a lot better. The Chrome DevTools can do so much more than I thought! I have never really looked at any documentation before, so I'll have to do that. I know I'll be using it a lot more often now.
