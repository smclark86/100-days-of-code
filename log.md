# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: June 10, Saturday — 3.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I joined FreeCodeCamp (FCC), and did the intro challenges. I also joined CodeAcademy and did 57% of the HTML & CSS tutorials on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: I've had some minor experience with coding since high school, but have never really committed to learning. After finishing the sections I did today in FCC I realize that I have really only been barely scratching the surface all these years. I've mainly decided to work on learning since I want to pursue a Masters in Nursing Informatics in the future, and figured a background in coding and application design might help me be more successful.


### Day 2: June 11, Sunday — 7 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the HTML & CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, Gear Up for Success, and started jQuery on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I know I shouldn't be going through these too quickly, but since I am somewhat familiar with some of the concepts from HTML & CSS I am learning quickly. I know I'll need to review though. And keep focused on finishing my Bachelors degree...only two more months to go until graduation!
