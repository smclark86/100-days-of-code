# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: June 10, Saturday - 3.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today I joined FreeCodeCamp (FCC), and did the intro challenges. I also joined CodeAcademy and did 57% of the HTML & CSS tutorials on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: I've had some minor experience with coding since high school, but have never really committed to learning. After finishing the sections I did today in FCC I realize that I have really only been barely scratching the surface all these years. I've mainly decided to work on learning since I want to pursue a Masters in Nursing Informatics in the future, and figured a background in coding and application design might help me be more successful.


### Day 2: June 11, Sunday - 7 hours

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the HTML & CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, Gear Up for Success, and started jQuery on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I know I shouldn't be going through these too quickly, but since I am somewhat familiar with some of the concepts from HTML & CSS I am learning quickly. I know I'll need to review though. And keep focused on finishing my Bachelors degree...only two more months to go until graduation!

### Day 3: June 12, Monday - 3.75 hours

**Today's Progress**: I completed the HTML & CSS course on CodeAcademy, and started the Make a Website course there. I have also completed the jQuery segment on FCC. Now I shall begin the first of the FCC Front End Development projects: The Tribute Page.

**Thoughts**: This FCC project is interesting. I think it will help me be more proficient in remembering the basics of HTML and CSS, though I'm not sure yet if I'll have to use any of the jQuery stuff I learned at this point. More updates soon.
